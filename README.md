# vagrant-k8s-single-cluster
In this lab i build up a single kubernetes cluster with vagrant ( 1 master and 3 workers ) in VirtualBox.

# How to use

It's pretty simple to use it. Make sure you are in the right directory where vagrantfile exists and you have already installed vagrant on your host machine, then execute it as command below :

> *vagrant up*

There you go!
